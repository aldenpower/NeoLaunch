# NeoLaunch
A Linux desktop application that opens terminal in fullscreen and runs a Matrix-style animation.

## Motivation

This project was created to bridge the gap between command-line knowledge and desktop-level application integration, demonstrating:

- Linux desktop entries (.desktop)
- Application icons
- Terminal emulator automation
- Bash scripting
- Fullscreen window handling
- User-level application installation
